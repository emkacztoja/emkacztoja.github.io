            <p>Actually there were not one, but two starts.<br>
                How is that possible?<br>
                As you may already know I'm keen on both Cars and Photography.<br>
                Since very young age I was basically in Love with anything that went 
                Vroom Vroom.<br> You're probably wondering why,<br> but to be honest I'm
                not 100% sure.<br> I just felt that strange connection with automotive.<br>
                It's actually very similar story with Photography,<br> because when I saw
                someone talk about it on Instagram,<br> I realised "That's exactly what
                I want to do in Life." And now you know how I became 'me'.​​​​​​​</p>
